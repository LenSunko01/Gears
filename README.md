# Gears

An online game for two players for Android 

## Rules

At the beginning of the game, each player is given a set of 12 tokens. The object of the game is to move all your tokens to the bottom of the board before your opponent does so. Players take turns; in one move, you can turn exactly one gear as many times as you like in any direction. 

Remember that your every move can both help and hinder your opponent! 

## Personal account

Each player has their own personal account where game statistics, rating and optionally profile pictures are stored.

## Rating system
The game can end with either a victory of one of the players or a draw. 

After that, the player's rating is recalculated, and the opponent's rating is taken into account in the recalculation (the weaker the opponent, the more expensive it is for them to lose, and vice versa) 

## Messages and timing 
During the game, you can send stickers to your opponent, but hurry up, because the turn time is limited!
